# Weather app

A React app created using Vite and fetching data from openweathermap.org to provide the
current weather in the location you provide. For countries that share the same city or town names you can add the country code to indicate which country you want eg Birmingham, GB will return the UK city weather and not the US city.

## Getting started

First, run the dev server
```bash
  npm run dev
```

You will need an API key to run this app. You can download one from [openweathermap]('https://openweathermap.org/api')

## Using the app

Enter the location in the search bar and press the enter key. The location's weather will be displayed.

A working version of this can be found at [wes-weather-app](https://wes-weather-app.surge.sh/)
